# VandeBharatBooking

Leveraging Node.js with the Hapi.js framework and TypeScript, I designed and implemented robust backend services that empowered users to seamlessly book tickets for the prestigious Vande Bharat Express train. Our solution was backed by MongoDB, ensuring data reliability and scalability. Through this project, I honed my skills in full-stack development, delivering a user-friendly platform that enhanced the travel experience for countless passengers.
